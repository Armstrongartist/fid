<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

<p> This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My Father recommends:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In winter, try serving it warm."</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 8ox. Jar of sun-dried tomatoes</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
<li>2/3 cup kalamata olives</li>
<li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>


<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li> Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible.</li>

<li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some texture.</li>

<li> serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and a fresh basil garnish (optional).</li>
<ol>
